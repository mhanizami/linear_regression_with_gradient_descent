# linear Regression with Gradient Descent
This is my first attempt at writing a machine learning algorithm: Multivariate Linear Regression with Gradient Descent. I hope to receive feedback on this algorithm to make it more generalized and hopefully to learn about version control as well.

The current code requires a .csv file to extract examples from (with the first column being the output) and maps maps given inputs to desired outputs by fitting a straight line through the dataset.
